@ flushing without deleting cluster :

- Scale Down the StatefulSet:

Use the kubectl scale command to scale down the number of replicas for your StatefulSet to 0.

kubectl scale statefulset <statefulset-name> --replicas=0
Replace <statefulset-name> with the name of your MongoDB StatefulSet.

- Wait for Pods to Terminate:

Wait for Kubernetes to terminate the existing pods. You can monitor the status using:

kubectl get pods -w
The pods should eventually reach a Terminating state and then be deleted.

- Delete the StatefulSet:

After the pods are terminated, you can delete the StatefulSet:

kubectl delete statefulset <statefulset-name>
Delete the PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs):

- Delete storage

If you have persistent storage associated with your StatefulSet, you may also want to delete the associated PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

kubectl delete pvc -l app=<statefulset-name>
Check for AWS Resources:

Verify that the AWS resources (EC2 instances, EBS volumes, etc.) associated with the nodes are terminated or deleted. You can check the AWS Management Console or use AWS CLI commands.
